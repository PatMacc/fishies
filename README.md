# fishies
This repo revolves around fishes...there is no motive here it's just fish. Now this consists of minigame and analysis survey, both written in python. I plan to expand this repo in the future, as it is my playground and experiment lab! 

# Fishies minigame
It is, what it's called- a minigame. There is no complicated mechanics, an open world etc. Whole concept is basically rock, paper, scissors, but fishy :)
It is written using only pure python and You can play as long as You want to. Fun fact: this project was created by accident (in some way), when I needed
to practice writing in python for exam. I've came up with this random concept and went with it :)

# FishPond Analysis 
This particular project was more of a challenge for me, as it is written in Python and libraries: NumPy,Pandas and SciPy. Similarly to Fishies minigame, main reason
of this file was to train mentioned libraries syntax, but I've got hooked on the process and add some elements of user input to automate, but also to match the theme 
of fishies. :)
# Go ahead, and test them both. I know, they are not tech-masterpieces, but I loved creation process and the outcome :)
